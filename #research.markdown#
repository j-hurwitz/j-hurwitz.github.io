### Fast KModes Clustering for Sparse Binary Data (2022)
 ![KModes Clustering - from Midjourney](/assets/kmodes.png){: width="150"}

Designed and implemented a complete scikit-learn-style Python package which performs fast KModes machine learning clustering on sparse binary data. Delivered a significant 20-30x speedup factor over popular open-source implementation. Productized and delivered to mission customer application. Utilized for daily scheduled ML clustering.

### Lempel Ziv Networks (2021)
![Recurrent Neural Network combined with Symbolic AI - from Midjourney](/assets/rnn.png){: width="150"}

Extend a sequence processing algorithm (LZJD) intended for discrete data to the domain of real-valued data through a custom recurrent neural network architecture. Gathered baseline metrics by training an LSTM for time series classification across 128 datasets in the UCR Time Series Archive. Features in NeurIPS 2022 Workshop "I Can't Believe It's Not Better!"
