Hi, welcome to my website. I am a computer programmer focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning. I got my M.S in Computer Science from University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), and B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from University at Albany, SUNY (UAlbany). I am looking to start a PhD program in Fall 2024.

I'm a musician and singer/songwriter, mostly playing indie/folk acoustic music. I [play live regularly](/music), and my released music is available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3mWRgP603oVga3g0Y4DZoC?si=3J_Gw9FgSKGBr_4y9dMK2g) and [Bandcamp](https://animal-project.bandcamp.com/).

I [train jiu jitsu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7TQpEDYzCg) and Muay Thai, and am currently a jiu jitsu blue belt under Stephen Miller at Rising Tide Academy in Maryland.
