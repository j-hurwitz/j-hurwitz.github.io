Hi! I am a graduate student in computer science at University of Maryand, Baltimore County (UMBC) focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning. I have a day job doing computer science and machine learning research/engineering. I got my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from University at Albany, SUNY (UAlbany). 

I'm a musician and singer/songwriter, mostly playing indie/folk acoustic music. My released music is available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3mWRgP603oVga3g0Y4DZoC?si=3J_Gw9FgSKGBr_4y9dMK2g) and [Bandcamp](https://animal-project.bandcamp.com/).

I train brazilian jiu jitsu and am currently a blue belt under Stephen Miller at Rising Tide Academy in Maryland.
