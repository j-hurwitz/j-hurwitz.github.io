Hi, welcome to my website. I am a computer science PhD student at University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning. I got my M.S in computer science from UMBC (2023), and B.S. in computer science and mathematics from University at Albany, SUNY (2019).

I'm a musician and singer/songwriter, mostly playing indie/folk acoustic music. I [play live regularly](/music), and my released music is available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3mWRgP603oVga3g0Y4DZoC?si=3J_Gw9FgSKGBr_4y9dMK2g) and [Bandcamp](https://animal-project.bandcamp.com/).

I [train jiu jitsu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7TQpEDYzCg) and Muay Thai, and am currently a jiu jitsu blue belt under Stephen Miller at Rising Tide Academy in Maryland.
